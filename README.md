## Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

### Overview
In the competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Customer churn, where users leave for another provider, directly impacts revenue and growth. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers with a high probability of churning, enabling the company to develop targeted retention strategies.

### Project Objective
The primary goal is to predict customer churn using historical data. This will help:
Identify customers at high risk of leaving.
Understand key factors contributing to churn.
Develop focused retention programs to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information, including:
Churn Status: Indicates whether a customer left within the last month.
Services Signed Up: Includes details on phone services, multiple lines, internet services, online security, backups, device protection, tech support, and streaming options.
Account Information: Tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing preference, monthly charges, and total charges.
Demographics: Gender, age range, marital status (partnered or not), and dependents.
Each row represents a customer, and each column describes an attribute as detailed in the metadata.

### Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and ensure consistency in data formatting.
Feature Engineering: Derive new features that could indicate churn behavior (e.g., average monthly charges per tenure).
Class Balancing: Address dataset imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze patterns and correlations in customer attributes.
Visualize trends in churn across demographics, services, and account details.

3. Predictive Modeling
Use machine learning algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
Evaluate models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

4. Feature Importance
Identify key predictors of churn using interpretable models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.
Visualize important features through plots or summary tables.


### How to Use This Repository
Load the dataset into your preferred programming environment (e.g., Python with Pandas).
Follow the provided scripts for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
Evaluate model performance using test datasets.
Use insights from the model to guide business decisions.

### Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization

#### By leveraging historical data and predictive analytics, this project aims to empower the telecom company with actionable insights to enhance customer retention efforts effectively.
